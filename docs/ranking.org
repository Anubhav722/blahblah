* Filter-API Ranking system
  - Ranking is one of the main functionaliy of the filter-api. This is usually done asynchoronously (via celery tasks)
  - The ranking system is broadly classified into three types. Coding, Skill and Social
  - We can add other types also going forward.
* Coding Ranking
** Github
   - Reputation-Score
     - Based On: No of followers
     - First calculate: how long the user is using the Github based on the time he signed up.
     - This value can be one of the New, Medium or Old.
     - Based on this value we allocate score according to the mapping present in resume/utils/ranking/github.py
     - The maximum score any user can get is 0.2
   - Contribution-Score
     - Based On: No of repos
     - Based on the number of repos, we allocate score according to the `USER_CONTRIBUTION_MAPPING` in resume/utils/ranking/github.py
     - The maximum score any user can get is 0.6
   - Activity-Score
     - Based on: How often he uses github
     - We divide user into two broad categories ACTIVE or INACTIVE
     - Active User would get the score of 0.2
     - Inactive user would get the score of 0.1
     - The maximum score any user can get is 0.2
   - Total-Score
     - Total score is always the sum of reputation, contribution and activity scores.
     - i.e: 0.2 + 0.6 + 0.2
     - The maximum score cannot exceed 1
** Stackoverflow

   - Activity
     - Exactly same as calculated for playstore.
     - Except here the threshold value is 6 months (whether update is released)
* Skill Ranking
  Skill ranking is calculated dynamically based on supplied skills. It is helpful to identify how good the candidate is with respect to the given skills requirements
  - Its further sub divided into two types. Exact match and Similarity Match
  - Exact match is simple. It try to match the supplied skill directly with resume (e.g: javascript -> javascript)
  - Similarity match is based on Latent Semantic Analysis (explained in different doc) (e.g: mysql -> postgres)
  - Exact match gets the complete score, where similarity match gets half the score
  - Total skill score is combination of exact match and similarity match
  - The maximum score it can get is 1.0 (only if all the required skills are exactly matched)
  - for e.g: Lets say resume have skills "javascript" and "postgres". And lets say required skills are "javascript" and "mysql". Candidate will get 75% match (0.75 score)
